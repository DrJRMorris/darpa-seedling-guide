# DARPA Seedling Application Roadmap
## College of Science Faculty Guide

### What Are Seedlings?

DARPA seedlings are small, exploratory research projects designed to test high-risk concepts before committing to full programs. They aim to transform ideas from "disbelief" (clearly won't work) to "doubt" (might actually work)—which for DARPA is the sweet spot for new programs.

**Typical Parameters:**
- **Duration:** 3-9 months (up to 12 months possible)
- **Funding:** Less than $1M (often $300K-$500K)
- **Personnel:** Very limited team
- **Goal:** Answer a specific technical question or validate a novel concept

---

### Why Pursue a Seedling?

- **Speed:** Rolling submissions with potential 30-day awards for projects under $2M
- **Flexibility:** Open topics within broad technical areas
- **Access:** Direct connection to DARPA program managers and DoD community
- **Gateway:** Successful seedlings often lead to larger DARPA programs ($5M-$50M+)
- **Freedom:** Fundamental research with no publication restrictions

---

### Eligibility

- U.S. and non-U.S. institutions (universities, non-profits, small businesses)
- No citizenship requirements for fundamental research
- Single PI proposals (no co-PIs required, though team members allowed)
- FFRDCs, UARCs, and National Labs are excluded

### The Application Process

#### STEP 1: Identify the Right Office and Program Manager

Review DARPA's six technical offices and their current interests:

- **Defense Sciences Office (DSO):** Physical sciences, materials, quantum, mathematics
- **Information Innovation Office (I2O):** AI, cybersecurity, software, resilient systems
- **Microsystems Technology Office (MTO):** Photonics, quantum microsystems, semiconductors
- **Biological Technologies Office (BTO):** Biosecurity, human performance, bioelectronics
- **Tactical Technology Office (TTO):** Autonomous systems, platforms, manufacturing
- **Strategic Technology Office (STO):** Space, maritime, positioning/navigation

#### STEP 2: Contact the Program Manager

**CRITICAL:** Reach out to relevant PMs BEFORE submitting anything formal.

Email or call to:
- Describe your concept (2-3 paragraphs)
- Ask if it aligns with their interests
- Request guidance on framing for a proposal
- Discuss whether it's appropriate for a seedling

*PMs expect and welcome these conversations. They want to help shape good ideas.*

#### STEP 3: Submit Executive Summary (Strongly Recommended)

After PM discussion, submit a 2-page executive summary through the office-wide BAA.

**What to include:**
- Problem statement and why it matters for national security
- Your innovative approach
- What you'll accomplish in 6-9 months
- Required resources
- Your relevant expertise

**Outcome:** DARPA will respond with either:
- Encouragement to submit full proposal
- Feedback on how to improve the concept
- Statement of no interest (saving you time)

#### STEP 4: Submit Full Proposal

If encouraged, prepare full proposal using templates in the BAA.

**Key sections:**
- Technical approach (10-20 pages depending on office)
- Management plan
- Cost proposal with detailed budget justification
- Statements of work with specific milestones

**Timeline:** Allow 2-4 weeks for full proposal preparation after executive summary feedback.

### Tips for Success

1. **Think revolutionary, not incremental:** DARPA explicitly excludes evolutionary improvements
2. **Connect to national security:** Even basic science needs clear defense relevance
3. **Be specific about the seedling goal:** What specific question will you answer in 6-9 months?
4. **Leverage Virginia Tech strengths:** Highlight unique facilities, expertise, or capabilities
5. **Keep it simple:** Small team, focused objective, clear deliverables
6. **Budget realistically:** Include travel to Arlington for meetings with PM

### What Happens After Selection?

- Assigned DARPA PM becomes your mentor and project manager
- Regular check-ins and technical discussions
- Possible visits to DoD facilities
- If successful, potential invitation to propose full program
- Connection to DoD transition partners
